        {
          "Primitive Data Types": ["byte", "short", "int", "long"]
        },
        {
          "Non-Primitive Data Types": ["Strings", "Arrays", "Classes"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

## Generating Content with ChatGPT

You can use ChatGPT to generate a comprehensive syllabus in the correct JSON format. Here's the prompt to use:

```text
I need a comprehensive programming syllabus in JSON format. The structure should follow this exact format:

{
  "Language Name": {
    "section_name": {
      "--section_title": [
        "topic1",
        {
          "subtopic_name": [
            "item1",
            "item2",
            "item3"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}

Important rules to follow:
1. Use "--" prefix for section titles that act as separators
2. Each topic can have subtopics as nested objects with arrays
3. Keep topic names clear and descriptive
4. Follow a logical learning progression
5. Include all major concepts from basics to advanced

The syllabus should cover:
- Basic concepts and syntax
- Object-Oriented Programming
- Data Structures (if applicable)
- Standard Libraries
- Memory Management
- Advanced Features
- Best Practices
- Common Applications

Please generate a complete, well-structured JSON following this format exactly. The structure will be used to generate documentation files automatically.
